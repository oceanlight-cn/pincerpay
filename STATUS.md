# Project Status

Last updated: 2026-03-03

## Deployed — Docs Screenshots (2026-03-03)

### Playwright Screenshot Pipeline
- [x] Screenshots script generates 26 images: 12 tour steps, 5 component isolations, 9 doc section crops
- [x] `deviceScaleFactor: 2` for Retina-quality output (2x pixel density)
- [x] 6 curated screenshots published to `apps/dashboard/public/docs/`

### Docs Image Embeds
- [x] README: hero playground flow screenshot after architecture diagram
- [x] getting-started: x402 payment flow + endpoint picker screenshots
- [x] quickstart-agent: agent config, spend tracker, flow visualizer screenshots
- [x] example-agent-weather: flow visualizer + response panel screenshots
- [x] Merchant docs intentionally left image-free (no agent simulator screenshots in merchant-facing pages)

## Deployed — Docs Consolidation + Demo Integration (2026-03-03)

### Docs Single Source of Truth
- [x] In-app docs (`/dashboard/docs`) now load from markdown files instead of hardcoded JSX
- [x] Created `faq.md` for FAQ content previously hardcoded in JSX
- [x] Supported Chains table remains dynamic JSX (from `@pincerpay/core`)
- [x] Split `concepts.md` into 4 focused pages: x402, AP2, UCP, Chain Architecture

### Demo Site Integration
- [x] Added "Demo" nav link to site header (desktop + mobile), links to demo.pincerpay.com
- [x] Added "Try the Demo" CTA on landing page
- [x] Added demo callouts in 6 doc pages: getting-started, quickstart-agent, quickstart-merchant, agent-sdk, testing, FAQ
- [x] Fixed demo code snippet: `agent.fetch()` returns `Response`, added `.json()` step
- [x] Fixed tour: removed false claim that Squads SPN middleware enforces limits server-side
- [x] Labeled Squads Smart Account as "Coming Soon" in demo config panel and tour
- [x] Fixed "sub-second finality" to "sub-second latency"
- [x] Removed em dashes from demo copy

### Deploy Infrastructure
- [x] Fixed Vercel deploy scripts: `--cwd` doubled the path with server-side Root Directory setting
- [x] Deploy scripts now source `.vercel/env.sh` (gitignored) for project IDs
- [x] Added `.npmrc` with `script-shell=bash` for pnpm scripts on Windows

## Deployed — SDK Docs + Security + CI Fix (2026-03-03)

### SDK Docs Reconciliation
- [x] Fixed agent-demo merchant server: replaced non-existent curried `pay()` API with real `pincerpay({ routes })` middleware
- [x] Fixed dashboard docs page: corrected Agent SDK snippets (solanaPrivateKey, chains, policies)
- [x] Fixed setup wizard: corrected agent snippet + PINCERPAY_WALLET -> MERCHANT_ADDRESS env var
- [x] Fixed agent-demo README: updated merchant code examples to match real API
- [x] Updated examples to Solana-first patterns (agent-weather, express-merchant)

### Security & Dependencies
- [x] Patched hono 4.12.0 -> 4.12.3 (IP spoofing in AWS Lambda ALB conninfo)
- [x] Patched rollup 4.57.1 -> 4.59.0 (arbitrary file write via path traversal)
- [x] Patched minimatch 10.2.1 -> 10.2.3 (ReDoS via combinatorial backtracking)
- [x] Dismissed 8 remaining Dependabot alerts (transitive deps, no fix available)
- [x] Zero open Dependabot alerts

### CI / Deployment Pipeline
- [x] Fixed CI: marketing app `vitest` failing with no test files (added --passWithNoTests)
- [x] Fixed Railway auto-deploy: CI was blocking deploys since monorepo migration
- [x] Railway facilitator settings: root directory `/`, Dockerfile path `apps/facilitator/Dockerfile`, cleared custom build command
- [x] Deployed: Dashboard (Vercel `vercel --prod`), Facilitator (Railway `railway up`)

### Other
- [x] Added examples/* to pnpm workspace
- [x] Added initial Drizzle migration snapshot
- [x] Added quickstart docs (merchant + agent)
- [x] Added OpenGraph and Twitter image routes
- [x] Added Next.js merchant example

## Completed — Pre-Mainnet Preparation (2026-02-22)

### npm Package Publish Readiness (#49, #87)
- [x] Root MIT LICENSE file
- [x] Metadata added to all 7 publishable package.json files (license, description, keywords, repository, homepage, bugs, files)
- [x] `prepublishOnly` script added to all 7 publishable packages
- [x] Publish workflow updated: added @pincerpay/db + @pincerpay/solana to options, fixed `all` publish order (core db solana program agent merchant mcp)

### Developer Experience (#50, #53)
- [x] AGENTS.md created (repo structure, package graph, commands, architecture, env vars, conventions)
- [x] .cursor/rules/pincerpay.mdc created (tech stack, conventions, file patterns)
- [x] Root llms.txt created (matches dashboard public/llms.txt)
- [x] README updated with Examples section (express-merchant, agent-weather, pincerpay-agent-demo)
- [x] Closed stale issues #2 and #3

### OFAC Compliance Screening (#19)
- [x] Compliance module: types, OFAC SDN provider, Hono middleware, barrel export
- [x] SDN list parser: fetches Treasury sdnlist.txt, parses crypto addresses, Set-based O(1) lookup, daily refresh
- [x] Config: `OFAC_ENABLED` (default false) + `OFAC_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MS` (default 24h)
- [x] Facilitator integration: middleware on /v1/settle and /v1/settle-direct, health endpoint shows compliance status
- [x] DB schema: compliance_events table (address, result, reason, matched_list, transaction_id)
- [x] 10 compliance tests passing

### Squads SPN Integration (Phase S2)
- [x] Squads validation middleware: extracts payer from Solana tx, checks agent status + spending limits
- [x] Middleware returns 403 for revoked/paused agents, per-tx limit exceeded, exhausted spending limits
- [x] Settle route enhanced: auto-discovers Squads PDAs on agent registration (fire-and-forget)
- [x] 12 Squads validation tests passing
- [x] Middleware pipeline: CORS > Logging > Auth > Rate limit > OFAC > Squads > Route handler

### Validation
- [x] `pnpm typecheck` — zero errors (15 tasks, 10 packages)
- [x] `pnpm test` — 190 tests (180 passed, 10 skipped e2e devnet)
- [x] `pnpm build` — all packages build clean including Next.js dashboard

## Completed — Kora E2E Payment Test (2026-02-22)

E2E Kora gasless payment test PASSING on Solana devnet.
- TX: `3SFTEnHnAbfvNUm4UyBWuUXSBkWxkDkGTERvzcJaeTgAbnZd5wdX8y1H4Pmn3TPjGCaiZ42Mgs9Dhn51DWYSJvbC`
- Agent paid 0.001 USDC, Kora paid SOL gas
- Verify + Settle both pass against live facilitator

### Bugs fixed (all deployed):
1. **`accepted` field missing** in paymentPayload (x402 V2 scheme requires it)
2. **Wrong Kora response field** (`result.transaction` -> `result.signed_transaction`)
3. **Double-signing** (`sendTransaction` called Kora `signAndSendTransaction` on already-signed tx)
4. **Raw fetch for sendTransaction** (replaced `@solana/kit` `rpc.sendTransaction()` with raw JSON-RPC fetch)

## Last Deploy
- **Facilitator**: Railway — 2026-02-22T15:39Z (Kora gasless e2e passing)
- **Kora Signer**: Railway — 2026-02-22T07:15Z (new service, `resplendent-freedom`)
- **Dashboard**: Vercel — 2026-03-03 (docs screenshots at 2x resolution)
- **Agent Demo**: Vercel — 2026-02-22 `demo.pincerpay.com` (Squads SPN spending limits parity)

## Phase 1 MVP — Deployed to Production

- **Solana facilitator wallet**: `53qkLfXNnLr9zy4utAvkgQz7DcuuPyQzNLyMj3TcR3zL` (devnet) — fallback only
- **EVM facilitator wallet**: `0x960E470581d17BcCd272F5Bd76A094077Cd907FE` (Base Sepolia) — optional
- **Anchor program**: `E53zfNo9DYxAUCu37bA2NakJMMbzPFszjgB5kPaTMvF3` (Solana devnet)
  - Authority: `GjsWy1viAxWZkb4VyLVz3oU7sNpvyuKXnRu11uUybNgm`
  - Config PDA: `Qa4Vp4kMKD5P8syNrc1ywz7WHiCt4poyykCKR21zLxP`
  - Test merchant PDA: `7Vvz1mCcNwcbSJ9Le1HXZ9ztYcmwN36zXK57evWRJ1dC`
